The shared dependencies between the files we are generating are:

1. **Next.js**: This is the main framework used for building the application. It is used in all the files for server-side rendering and routing.

2. **React**: Next.js is built on top of React, so React is a shared dependency across all the files. It is used to create components (like Header and Footer) and pages (_app, _document, index).

3. **TypeScript**: TypeScript is used across all the files for type checking and improved developer experience. It is used in the tsconfig.json file and in all the .tsx files.

4. **CSS Modules**: CSS Modules are used for styling the components and pages. They are used in the globals.css and Home.module.css files.

5. **Public Assets**: Public assets like favicon.ico and vercel.svg are shared dependencies as they are used across the application for branding and UI purposes.

6. **Package.json**: This file contains the list of all the dependencies and scripts for the application. It is a shared dependency as it affects all the other files.

7. **.next/config.js**: This file is used to customize the behavior of Next.js. It is a shared dependency as it affects the behavior of the entire application.

8. **DOM Elements**: The id names of DOM elements that JavaScript functions will use are shared dependencies. These ids are used to manipulate the DOM and add interactivity to the application.

9. **Function Names**: Function names are shared dependencies as they are used across multiple files. These functions provide the functionality for the application.

10. **Exported Variables**: Exported variables are shared dependencies as they are used across multiple files. These variables store data that is used throughout the application.
